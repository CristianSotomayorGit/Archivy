      Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:
      <br /><br />

      We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks,
      including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and
      research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These
      advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile
      categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based
      Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be
      provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular
      users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information
      may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and
      unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To
      accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies,
      including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you
      through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized,
      aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.
      Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to
      you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view,
      edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had
      requested a web page from their site. Data Security

      appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on
      mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and
