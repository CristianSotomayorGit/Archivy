 ‌ Federal Register Adoption of the 2010 Standards also establishes a revised
  reference point for Title II entities that choose to make structural changes
  to existing facilities to meet their program accessibility requirements; and
  it establishes a similar reference for Title III entities undertaking readily
  achievable barrier removal. The Department is providing this document with the
  official 2010 Standards in one publication. The document includes: The 2010
  Standards for State and local governments, which consist of the Title II
  regulations at 28 CFR 35.151 and the 2004 ADAAG at 36 CFR part 1191,
  appendices B and D; The 2010 Standards for public accommodations and
  commercial facilities, which consist of the Title III regulations at 28 CFR
  part 36, subpart D, and the 2004 ADAAG at 36 CFR part 1191, appendices B and
  D. The Department has assembled into a separate publication the revised
  regulation guidance that applies to the Standards. The Department included
  guidance in its revised ADA regulations published on September 15, 2010. This
  guidance provides detailed information about the Department’s adoption of the
  2010 Standards including changes to the Standards, the reasoning behind those
  changes, and responses to public comments received on these topics. The
  document, Guidance on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, can be

<div class="(a) Design and construction. " id="bookmark8">
 Design and construction. Each facility or part of a facility constructed by,
  on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed and
  constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is
  readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the
  construction was commenced after January 26, 1992. Exception for structural
  impracticability. Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not
  required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally
  impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered
  structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique
  characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility
  features. If full compliance with this section would be structurally
  impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it
  is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility
  that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is
  not structurally impracticable. If providing accessibility in conformance with
  this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use
  wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall
  nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities, (e.g.,
  those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in
  accordance with this section.
</div>
<div class="(b) Alterations. " id="bookmark9">
 Alterations. Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or
  for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the
  usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent
  feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility
  is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the
  alteration was commenced after January 26, 1992. The path of travel
  requirements of § 35.151(b)(4) shall apply only to alterations undertaken
  solely for purposes other than to meet the program accessibility requirements
  of § 35.150. ​ Alterations to historic properties shall comply, to the maximum
  extent feasible, with the provisions applicable to historic properties in the
  design standards specified in § 35.151(c). If it is not feasible to provide
  physical access to an historic property in a manner that will not threaten or
  destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, alternative
  methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of § 35.150.
  An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an
  area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to
  ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered
  area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered
  area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,
  including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such
  alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. . A
  “primary function” is a major activity for which the facility is intended.
  Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the
  dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well
  as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public entity
  using the facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply
  storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets,
  entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function.
  Restrooms are not areas containing a primary function unless the provision of
  restrooms is a primary purpose of the area, e.g., in highway rest stops. For
  the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls,
  electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be alterations that
  affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function. A
  “path of travel” includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage
  by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and
  which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including
  sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other
  parts of the facility. An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and
  sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear
  floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas;
  parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these
  elements. For the purposes of this section, the term “path of travel” also
  includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered
  area. Safe harbor. If a public entity has constructed or altered required
  elements of a path of travel in accordance with the specifications in either
  the 1991 Standards or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards before March
  15, 2012, the public entity is not required to retrofit such elements to
  reflect incremental changes in the 2010 Standards solely because of an
  alteration to a primary function area served by that path of travel.
  Disproportionality. Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel
  to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration
  when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary
  function area. Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide
  an accessible path of travel may include: Costs associated with providing an
  accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example,
  the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps; Costs associated with
  making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet
  stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls; Costs
  associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the
  telephone to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or
  installing a text telephone (TTY); and Costs associated with relocating an
  inaccessible drinking fountain. Duty to provide accessible features in the
  event of disproportionality. When the cost of alterations necessary to make
  the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to
  the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made
  accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring
  disproportionate costs.
</div>
<div id="bookmark207">
 In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to
  those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order—
  An accessible entrance; An accessible route to the altered area; At least one
  accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; Accessible
  telephones; Accessible drinking fountains; and When possible, additional
  accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms. Series of smaller
  alterations. The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be
  evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a
  single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a
  single undertaking. ​ If an area containing a primary function has been
  altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and
  subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of
  travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the
  total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel
  during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining
  whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.
  Only alterations undertaken on or after March 15, 2011, shall be considered in
  determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is
  disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.

 Elevator exemption. For purposes of this paragraph (d)— means a location where
  a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional services
  related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes such services
  available to the public. The facility housing the “professional office of a
  health care provider” only includes floor levels housing at least one health
  care provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one
  health care provider. means— A building housing five or more sales or rental
  establishments; or A series of buildings on a common site, either under common
  ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series
  of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. For
  purposes of this section, places of public accommodation of the types listed

  housing a “shopping center or shopping mall” only includes floor levels
  housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level
  designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.
  This section does not require the installation of an elevator in a facility
  that is less than three stories or has less than 3000 square feet per story,
  except with respect to any facility that houses one or more of the following:
  A shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of a health care

<div class="(a) General. " id="bookmark27">
 General. Any alteration to a place of public accommodation or a commercial
  facility, after January 26, 1992, shall be made so as to ensure that, to the
  maximum extent feasible, the altered portions of the facility are readily
  accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including
  individuals who use wheelchairs. An alteration is deemed to be undertaken
  after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the property begins
  after that date.
</div>
<div class="(b) Alteration." id="bookmark28">
 Alteration. For the purposes of this part, an alteration is a change to a
  place of public accommodation or a commercial facility that affects or could
  affect the usability of the building or facility or any part thereof.
  Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation,
  rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement
  in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan
  configuration of walls and full- height partitions. Normal maintenance,
  reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, or changes to
  mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the
  usability of the building or facility. If existing elements, spaces, or common
  areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall comply
  with the applicable provisions of appendix A to this part.
</div>
<div class="(c) To the maximum extent feasible. " id="bookmark29">
 To the maximum extent feasible. The phrase “to the maximum extent feasible,”
  as used in this section, applies to the occasional case where the nature of an
  existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with
  applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In these
  circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility
  feasible. Any altered features of the facility that can be made accessible
  shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility in conformance

 § 36.403 Alterations: Path of travel.
</div>
<div class="(a) General. " id="bookmark31">
 General. An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access
  to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as
  to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the
  altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the
  altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
  disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and
  scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall
  alteration. If a private entity has constructed or altered required elements
  of a path of travel at a place of public accommodation or commercial facility
  in accordance with the specifications in the 1991 Standards, the private
  entity is not required to retrofit such elements to reflect the incremental
  changes in the 2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary
  function area served by that path of travel.
</div>
<div class="(b) Primary function. " id="bookmark32">
 Primary function. A “primary function” is a major activity for which the
  facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are
  not limited to, the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a
  cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and
  other work areas in which the activities of the public accommodation or other
  private entity using the facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler
  rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial

  surface in the customer service or employee work areas of a bank; Redesigning
  the assembly line area of a factory; or Installing a computer center in an
  accounting firm. For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows,
  hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be
  alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a
  primary function.
</div>
<div class="(d) Landlord/tenant: " id="bookmark34">
 Landlord/tenant: If a tenant is making alterations as defined in § 36.402 that
  would trigger the requirements of this section, those alterations by the
  tenant in areas that only the tenant occupies do not trigger a path of travel
  obligation upon the landlord with respect to areas of the facility under the
  landlord’s authority, if those areas are not otherwise being altered.
</div>
<div class="(e) Path of travel. " id="bookmark35">
 Path of travel. A “path of travel” includes a continuous, unobstructed way of
  pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached,
  entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior
  approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the
  facility, and other parts of the facility. An accessible path of travel may
  consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior
  pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and
  other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a
  combination of these elements. For the purposes of this part, the term “path
  of travel” also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains
  serving the altered area.
</div>
<div class="(f) Disproportionality. " id="bookmark36">
 Disproportionality. Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel
  to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration
  when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary
  function area.
</div>
<div id="bookmark217">
 Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible
  path of travel may include: Costs associated with providing an accessible
  entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of
  widening doorways or installing ramps; Costs associated with making restrooms
  accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating
  pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls; Costs associated with
  providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an
  accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing a text
  telephone (TTY). Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking
  fountain.
</div>
<div class="(g) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of
        disproportionality. " id="bookmark37">
 Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality. When
  the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered
  area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall
  alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it
  can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs. In choosing
  which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those
  elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order: An
  accessible entrance; An accessible route to the altered area; At least one
  accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; Accessible
  telephones; Accessible drinking fountains; and When possible, additional
  accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.

</div>
<div id="bookmark218">
 performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path
  of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single
  undertaking. ​ If an area containing a primary function has been altered
  without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent
  alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are
  undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of
  alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the
  preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the
  cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate. Only
  alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in
  determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is
  disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.

 Dimensions for Adults and Children The technical requirements are based on
  adult dimensions and anthropometrics. In addition, this document includes
  technical requirements based on children’s dimensions and anthropometrics for
  drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks,
  dining surfaces, and work surfaces.
</div>
<div class="103 Equivalent Facilitation " id="bookmark54">
 Equivalent Facilitation accessibility The responsibility for demonstrating
  equivalent facilitation in the event of a challenge rests with the covered
  entity. With the exception of transit facilities, which are covered by
  regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, there is no process
  for certifying that an alternative design provides equivalent facilitation.
</div>
<div class="104 Conventions " id="bookmark55">
 Conventions Dimensions that are not stated as “maximum” or “minimum” are
  absolute. All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances
  except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and
  maximum end points. Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this
  provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary
  consequence of a particular manufacturing process. Recognized tolerances are
  not intended to apply to design work. It is good practice when specifying
  dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute. For
  example, if this document requires “1½ inches,” avoid specifying “1½ inches
  plus or minus X inches.” Where the requirement states a specified range, such
  as in Section 609.4 where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36
  inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore
  no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted. Where a
  requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two
  specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply. Where an
  element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such
  as “15 inches minimum” or “5 pounds maximum”, it would not be good practice to
  specify “5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches).” Rather, it
  would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum
  (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or
  manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the
  specified dimension. Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described
  above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of
  accessibility intended by these requirements. It will also more often produce
  an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements
  and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.
  Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade
  organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.

  A18.1-1999 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts,
  including ASME A18.1a-2001 Addenda and ASME A18.1b-2001 Addenda (see 410.1).
  ASME A18.1-2003 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts,
  (see 410.1). ASME A17.1-2000 is used by local jurisdictions throughout the
  United States for the design, construction, installation, operation,
  inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators and
  escalators. The majority of the requirements apply to the operational
  machinery not seen or used by elevator passengers. ASME A17.1 requires a
  two-way means of emergency communications in passenger elevators. This means
  of communication must connect with emergency or authorized personnel and not
  an automated answering system. The communication system must be push button
  activated. The activation button must be permanently identified with the word
  “HELP.” A visual indication acknowledging the establishment of a
  communications link to authorized personnel must be provided. The visual
  indication must remain on until the call is terminated by authorized
  personnel. The building location, the elevator car number, and the need for
  assistance must be provided to authorized personnel answering the emergency
  call. The use of a handset by the communications system is prohibited. Only
  the authorized personnel answering the call can terminate the call. Operating
  instructions for the communications system must be provided in the elevator
  car. The provisions for escalators require that at least two flat steps be
  provided at the entrance and exit of every escalator and that steps on
  escalators be demarcated by yellow lines 2 inches wide maximum along the back
  and sides of steps. ASME A18.1-1999 and ASME A18.1-2003 address the design,
  construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance and
  repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of persons with
  disabilities. Lifts are classified as: vertical platform lifts, inclined
  platform lifts, inclined stairway chairlifts, private residence vertical
  platform lifts, private residence inclined platform lifts, and private
  residence inclined stairway chairlifts. This document does not permit the use
  of inclined stairway chairlifts which do not provide platforms because such
  lifts require the user to transfer to a seat. ASME A18.1 contains requirements
  for runways, which are the spaces in which platforms or seats move. The
  standard includes additional provisions for runway enclosures, electrical
  equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance (which is 80
  inches minimum), lower level access ramps and pits. The enclosure walls not
  used for entry or exit are required to have a grab bar the full length of the
  wall on platform lifts. Access ramps are required to meet requirements similar
  to those for ramps in Chapter 4 of this document. Each of the lift types
  addressed in ASME A18.1 must meet requirements for capacity, load, speed,
  travel, operating devices, and control equipment. The maximum permitted height
  for operable parts is consistent with Section 308 of this document. The
  standard also addresses attendant operation. However, Section 410.1 of this
  document does not permit attendant operation. Copies of the referenced
  standards may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials,
  100 Bar Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428 (http://

  Within the Use Zone of Playground Equipment (see 1008.2.6.2). ASTM F 1487-01
  Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specification for Playground Equipment
  for Public Use (see 106.5). ASTM F 1951-99 Standard Specification for
  Determination of Accessibility of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground
  Equipment (see 1008.2.6.1). ASTM F 1292-99 and ASTM F 1292-04 establish a
  uniform means to measure and compare characteristics of surfacing materials to
  determine whether materials provide a safe surface under and around playground
  equipment. These standards are referenced in the play areas requirements of
  this document when an accessible surface is required inside a play area use
  zone where a fall attenuating surface is also required. The standards cover
  the minimum impact attenuation requirements, when tested in accordance with
  Test Method F 355, for surface systems to be used under and around any piece
  of playground equipment from which a person may fall. ASTM F 1487-01
  establishes a nationally recognized safety standard for public playground
  equipment to address injuries identified by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
  Commission. It defines the use zone, which is the ground area beneath and
  immediately adjacent to a play structure or play equipment designed for
  unrestricted circulation around the equipment and on whose surface it is
  predicted that a user would land when falling from or exiting a play structure
  or equipment. The play areas requirements in this document reference the ASTM
  F 1487 standard when defining accessible routes that overlap use zones
  requiring fall attenuating surfaces. If the use zone of a playground is not
  entirely surfaced with an accessible material, at least one accessible route
  within the use zone must be provided from the perimeter to all accessible play
  structures or components within the playground. ASTM F 1951-99 establishes a
  uniform means to measure the characteristics of surface systems in order to
  provide performance specifications to select materials for use as an
  accessible surface under and around playground equipment. Surface materials
  that comply with this standard and are located in the use zone must also
  comply with ASTM F 1292. The test methods in this standard address access for
  children and adults who may traverse the surfacing to aid children who are
  playing. When a surface is tested it must have an average work per foot value
  for straight propulsion and for turning less than the average work per foot
  values for straight propulsion and for turning, respectively, on a hard,
  smooth surface with a grade of 7% (1:14). Copies of the referenced standard
  may be obtained from the International Code Council, 5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite
  600, Falls Church, Virginia 22041 ( www.iccsafe.org). International Building

  International Building Code, 2001 Supplement (see 207.1 and 207.2).
  International Building Code, 2003 Edition (see 207.1, 207.2, 216.4.2, 216.4.3,
  and 1005.2.1). International Building Code (IBC)-2000 (including 2001
  Supplement to the International Codes) and IBC-2003 are referenced for means
  of egress, areas of refuge, and railings provided on fishing piers and
  platforms. At least one accessible means of egress is required for every
  accessible space and at least two accessible means of egress are required
  where more than one means of egress is required. The technical criteria for
  accessible means of egress allow the use of exit stairways and evacuation
  elevators when provided in conjunction with horizontal exits or areas of
  refuge. While typical elevators are not designed to be used during an
  emergency evacuation, evacuation elevators are designed with standby power and
  other features according to the elevator safety standard and can be used for
  the evacuation of individuals with disabilities. The IBC also provides
  requirements for areas of refuge, which are fire-rated spaces on levels above
  or below the exit discharge levels where people unable to use stairs can go to
  register a call for assistance and wait for evacuation. The recreation
  facilities requirements of this document references two sections in the IBC
  for fishing piers and platforms. An exception addresses the height of the
  railings, guards, or handrails where a fishing pier or platform is required to
  include a guard, railing, or handrail higher than 34 inches (865 mm) above the
  ground or deck surface. Copies of the referenced standards may be obtained
  from the National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy,
  Massachusetts 02169-7471, (http:// www.nfpa.org). NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm
  Code, 1999 Edition (see 702.1 and 809.5.2). NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm Code,
  2002 Edition (see 702.1 and 809.5.2). NFPA 72-1999 and NFPA 72-2002 address
  the application, installation, performance, and maintenance of protective
  signaling systems and their components. The NFPA 72 incorporates Underwriters
  Laboratory (UL) 1971 by reference. The standard specifies the characteristics
  of audible alarms, such as placement and sound levels. However, Section 702 of
  these requirements limits the volume of an audible alarm to 110 dBA, rather
  than the maximum 120 dBA permitted by NFPA 72-1999. NFPA 72 specifies
  characteristics for visible alarms, such as flash frequency, color, intensity,
  placement, and synchronization. However, Section 702 of this document requires
  that visual alarm appliances be permanently installed. UL 1971 specifies
  intensity dispersion requirements for visible alarms. In particular, NFPA 72
  requires visible alarms to have a light source that is clear or white and has
  polar dispersion complying with UL 1971.

  Residential dwelling units shall not be required to comply with 202.4. An area
  of a building or facility containing a major activity for which the building
  or facility is intended is a primary function area. Department of Justice ADA
  regulations state, “Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel
  to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration
  when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary
  function area.” (28 CFR 36.403 (f)(1)). See also Department of Transportation
  ADA regulations, which use similar concepts in the context of public sector
  transportation facilities (49 CFR 37.43 (e)(1)). There can be multiple areas
  containing a primary function in a single building. Primary function areas are
  not limited to public use areas. For example, both a bank lobby and the bank’s
  employee areas such as the teller areas and walk-in safe are primary function
  areas. Also, mixed use facilities may include numerous primary function areas
  for each use. Areas containing a primary function do not include: mechanical
  rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms,
  janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, or restrooms. Alterations to

  alterations qualified historic buildings or facilities element State Historic
  Preservation Officers are State appointed officials who carry out certain
  responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act. State Historic
  Preservation Officers consult with Federal and State agencies, local
  governments, and private entities on providing access and protecting
  significant elements of qualified historic buildings and facilities. There are
  exceptions for alterations to qualified historic buildings and facilities for
  accessible routes (206.2.1 Exception 1 and 206.2.3 Exception 7); entrances
  (206.4 Exception 2); and toilet facilities (213.2 Exception 2). When an entity
  believes that compliance with the requirements for any of these elements would
  threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, the
  entity should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer. If the
  State Historic Preservation Officer agrees that compliance with the
  requirements for a specific element would threaten or destroy the historic
  significance of the building or facility, use of the exception is permitted.
  Public entities have an additional obligation to achieve program accessibility
  under the Department of Justice ADA regulations. See 28 CFR 35.150. These
  regulations require public entities that operate historic preservation
  programs to give priority to methods that provide physical access to
  individuals with disabilities. If alterations to a qualified historic building
  or facility to achieve program accessibility would threaten or destroy the
  historic significance of the building or facility, fundamentally alter the
  program, or result in undue financial or administrative burdens, the
  Department of Justice ADA regulations allow alternative methods to be used to
  achieve program accessibility. In the case of historic preservation programs,
  such as an historic house museum, alternative methods include using
  audio-visual materials to depict portions of the house that cannot otherwise
  be made accessible. In the case of other qualified historic properties, such
  as an historic government office building, alternative methods include
  relocating programs and services to accessible locations. The Department of
  Justice ADA regulations also allow public entities to use alternative methods
  when altering qualified historic buildings or facilities in the rare
  situations where the State Historic Preservation Officer determines that it is
  not feasible to provide physical access using the exceptions permitted in
  Section 202.5 without threatening or destroying the historic significance of
  the building or facility. See 28 CFR 35.151(d).

  be located in no fewer than 20% of the boxes covered by this section. For
  example, a concert hall has 20 boxes, each of which contains 10 seats,
  totaling 200 seats. In this example, 5 wheelchair spaces would be required,

  alterations technically infeasible A “cluster” is a group of rooms proximate
  to one another. Generally, rooms in a cluster are within sight of, or adjacent
  to, one another. Different styles of design provide users varying levels of
  privacy and convenience. Some designs include private changing facilities that
  are close to core areas of the facility, while other designs use space more
  economically and provide only group dressing facilities. Regardless of the
  type of facility, dressing, fitting, and locker rooms should provide people
  with disabilities rooms that are equally private and convenient to those
  provided others. For example, in a physician’s office, if people without
  disabilities must traverse the full length of the office suite in clothing
  other than their street clothes, it is acceptable for people with disabilities
  to be asked to do the same. Where coat hooks or shelves are provided in
  dressing, fitting or locker rooms without individual compartments, at least

  medical facilities frequently reconfigure spaces to reflect changes in medical
  specialties, Section 223.1 does not include a provision for dispersion of
  accessible patient or resident sleeping rooms. The lack of a design
  requirement does not mean that covered entities are not required to provide
  services to people with disabilities where accessible rooms are not dispersed
  in specialty areas. Locate accessible rooms near core areas that are less
  likely to change over time. While dispersion is not required, the flexibility
  it provides can be a critical factor in ensuring cost effective compliance

  be covered by both these requirements and the Fair Housing Amendments Act. The
  Fair Housing Amendments Act requires that certain residential structures
  having four or more multi-family dwelling units, regardless of whether they
  are privately owned or federally assisted, include certain features of
  accessible and adaptable design according to guidelines established by the
  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This law and the

 Amusement Rides General. musement rides EXCEPTION: amusement rides These
  requirements apply generally to newly designed and constructed amusement rides
  and attractions. A custom designed and constructed ride is new upon its first
  use, which is the first time amusement park patrons take the ride. With
  respect to amusement rides purchased from other entities, new refers to the
  first permanent installation of the ride, whether it is used off the shelf or
  modified before it is installed. Where amusement rides are moved after several
  seasons to another area of the park or to another park, the ride would not be
  considered newly designed or newly constructed. Some amusement rides and
  attractions that have unique designs and features are not addressed by these
  requirements. In those situations, these requirements are to be applied to the
  extent possible. An example of an amusement ride not specifically addressed by
  these requirements includes “virtual reality” rides where the device does not
  move through a fixed course within a defined area. An accessible route must be
  provided to these rides. Where an attraction or ride has unique features for
  which there are no applicable scoping provisions, then a reasonable number,
  but at least one, of the features must be located on an accessible route.
  Where there are appropriate technical provisions, they must be applied to the
  elements that are covered by the scoping provisions. Mobile or temporary rides
  are those set up for short periods of time such as traveling carnivals, State
  and county fairs, and festivals. The amusement rides that are covered by 234.1

  provisions in 234 requiring an accessible route to the load and unload areas
  and to the ride. The exception does not apply to those rides where patrons may
  cause the ride to make incidental movements, but where the patron otherwise
  has no control over the ride. The exception is limited to those rides designed
  “primarily” for children, where children are assisted on and off the ride by
  an adult. This exception is limited to those rides designed for children and
  not for the occasional adult user. An accessible route to and turning space in

  (7620 mm) long and 5 feet (1525 mm) wide (the minimum width specified by
  Section 1003.3) allows boats to moor on three sides. Because the number of
  boat slips is not demarcated, the total length of boat slip edge (55 feet, 17
  m) must be used to determine the number of boat slips provided (two). This
  number is based on the specification in Section 235.2 that each 40 feet (12 m)
  of boat slip edge, or fraction thereof, counts as one boat slip. In this
  example, Table 235.2 would require one boat slip to be accessible. Dispersion.

  the different types of ground level play components, consider the general
  experience provided by the play component. Examples of different types of
  experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing,
  spinning, and sliding. A spiral slide may provide a slightly different
  experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and
  therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component
  from a straight slide. Ground level play components accessed by children with
  disabilities must be integrated into the play area. Designers should consider
  the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with
  disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children.
  Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with
  disabilities in one location is not considered integrated. Where a stand-alone
  slide is provided, an accessible route must connect the base of the stairs at
  the entry point to the exit point of the slide. A ramp or transfer system to
  the top of the slide is not required. Where a sand box is provided, an
  accessible route must connect to the border of the sand box. Accessibility to
  the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or
  by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with 1008.4.3.
  Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use
  wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to
  use, transfer systems. Where ramps connect elevated play components, the
  maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm). Where possible,
  designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a slope less than
  the 1:12 maximum. Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and
  may be part of an accessible route to composite play structures. Platform
  lifts are permitted as a part of an accessible route. Because lifts must be

 Assistive Listening Systems General. required in shall comply with 706.
  Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of
  transmission. There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless
  systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission. Each has
  different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is
  best for a given application. For example, an FM system may be better than an
  infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less
  effective in sunlight. On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a
  better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important
  because it will be contained within a given space. The technical standards for
  assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume,
  interference, and distortion. Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in
  decibels, measure output sound volume. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N),
  also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness
  of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece
  of equipment. The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal. The peak
  clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when
  high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.
  Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or
  complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer. The
  Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices
  and systems. Receiver Jacks. assistive listening system

  are compatible with hearing aids. Receivers that are not compatible include
  earbuds, which may require removal of hearing aids, earphones, and headsets
  that must be worn over the ear, which can create disruptive interference in
  the transmission and can be uncomfortable for people wearing hearing aids.
  Assistive listening systems shall be capable of providing a sound pressure
  level of 110 dB minimum and 118 dB maximum with a dynamic range on the volume

 Automatic Teller Machines and Fare Machines Interactive transaction machines
  (ITMs), other than ATMs, are not covered by Section 707. However, for entities
  covered by the ADA, the Department of Justice regulations that implement the
  ADA provide additional guidance regarding the relationship between these
  requirements and elements that are not directly addressed by these
  requirements. Federal procurement law requires that ITMs purchased by the
  Federal government comply with standards issued by the Access Board under
  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. This law covers a
  variety of products, including computer hardware and software, websites, phone

  an ATM provides additional functions such as dispensing coupons, selling
  theater tickets, or providing copies of monthly statements, all such functions
  must be available to customers using speech output. To avoid confusion at the

  requirements do not establish a minimum length for accessible boarding piers
  at boat launch ramps. The accessible boarding pier should have a length at
  least equal to that of other boarding piers provided at the facility. If no
  other boarding pier is provided, the pier would have a length equal to what
  would have been provided if no access requirements applied. The entire length
  of accessible boarding piers would be required to comply with the same
  technical provisions that apply to accessible boat slips. For example, at a
  launch ramp, if a 20 foot (6100 mm) long accessible boarding pier is provided,
  the entire 20 feet (6100 mm) must comply with the pier clearance requirements
  in 1003.3. Likewise, if a 60 foot (18 m) long accessible boarding pier is
  provided, the pier clearance requirements in 1003.3 would apply to the entire
  60 feet (18 m). The following example applies to a boat launch ramp boarding
  pier: A chain of floats is provided on a launch ramp to be used as a boarding
  pier which is required to be accessible by 1003.3.2. At high water, the entire
  chain is floating and a transition plate connects the first float to the
  surface of the launch ramp. As the water level decreases, segments of the
  chain end up resting on the launch ramp surface, matching the slope of the
  launch ramp. Figure 1003.3.2 Boarding Pier Clearance

  One clear floor or ground space is permitted to be shared between two pieces
  of exercise equipment. To optimize space use, designers should carefully
  consider layout options such as connecting ends of the row and center aisle
  spaces. The position of the clear floor space may vary greatly depending on
  the use of the equipment or machine. For example, to provide access to a
  shoulder press machine, clear floor space next to the seat would be
  appropriate to allow for transfer. Clear floor space for a bench press machine
  designed for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair, however, will most
  likely be centered on the operating mechanisms.

  accessibility and better accommodate people with a wide range of disabilities.
  Pool lifts shall be located where the water level does not exceed 48 inches
  (1220 mm). Where the entire pool depth is greater than 48 inches (1220 mm),
  compliance with 1009.2.1 shall not be required. Where multiple pool lift
  locations are provided, no more than one pool lift shall be required to be
  located in an area where the water level is 48 inches (1220 mm) maximum. In
  the raised position, the centerline of the seat shall be located over the deck
  and 16 inches (405 mm) minimum from the edge of the pool. The deck surface
  between the centerline of the seat and the pool edge shall have a slope not
  steeper than 1:48. Figure 1009.2.2 Pool Lift Seat Location 1009.2.3 Clear Deck
  Space. space space space Figure 1009.2.3 Clear Deck Space at Pool Lifts The
  height of the lift seat shall be designed to allow a stop at 16 inches (405
  mm) minimum to 19 inches (485 mm) maximum measured from the deck to the top of
  the seat surface when in the raised (load) position. Figure 1009.2.4 Pool Lift
  Seat Height The seat shall be 16 inches (405 mm) wide minimum. Footrests shall
  be provided and shall move with the seat. If provided, the armrest positioned
  opposite the water shall be removable or shall fold clear of the seat when the
  seat is in the raised (load) position. Footrests shall not be required on pool
  lifts provided in spas. The lift shall be capable of unassisted operation from
  both the deck and water levels. Controls and operating mechanisms shall be
  unobstructed when the lift is in use and shall comply with 309.4. Pool lifts
  must be capable of unassisted operation from both the deck and water levels.
  This will permit a person to call the pool lift when the pool lift is in the
  opposite position. It is extremely important for a person who is swimming
  alone to be able to call the pool lift when it is in the up position so he or
  she will not be stranded in the water for extended periods of time awaiting
  assistance. The requirement for a pool lift to be independently operable does
  not preclude assistance from being provided. The lift shall be designed so
  that the seat will submerge to a water depth of 18 inches (455 mm) minimum
  below the stationary water level. Figure 1009.2.8 Pool Lift Submerged Depth

  minimum weight of 300 pounds (136 kg) and sustaining a static load of at least
  one and a half times the rated load. Pool lifts should be provided that meet
  the needs of the population they serve. Providing a pool lift with a weight
  capacity greater than 300 pounds (136 kg) may be advisable. Sloped entries
  shall comply with 1009.3. Personal wheelchairs and mobility devices may not be
  appropriate for submerging in water. Some may have batteries, motors, and
  electrical systems that when submerged in water may cause damage to the
  personal mobility device or wheelchair or may contaminate the pool water.
  Providing an aquatic wheelchair made of non-corrosive materials and designed
  for access into the water will protect the water from contamination and avoid
  damage to personal wheelchairs or other mobility aids. Sloped entries shall
  comply with Chapter 4 except as modified in 1109.3.1 through 1109.3.3. Where
  sloped entries are provided, the surfaces shall not be required to be slip
  resistant. Sloped entries shall extend to a depth of 24 inches (610 mm)
  minimum and 30 inches (760 mm) maximum below the stationary water level. Where
  landings are required by 405.7, at least one landing shall be located 24

  serving a sloped entry. Where a sloped entry is provided for wave action
  pools, leisure rivers, sand bottom pools, and other pools where user access is
  limited to one area, the handrails shall not be required to comply with the
  clear width requirements of 1009.3.3. Sloped entries in wading pools shall not
  be required to provide handrails complying with 1009.3.3. If provided,
