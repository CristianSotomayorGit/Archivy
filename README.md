# Archivy: Simplifying Construction Code Interpretation

## Project Description
Archivy is a Python and Flask-based web application designed to streamline the interpretation of construction codes for industry professionals. By integrating advanced machine learning models, including ChatGPT and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, Archivy offers a user-friendly platform for quickly accessing accurate building code information. The application utilizes a Pinecone vector database to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of search results, making it a powerful tool for architects, contractors, and construction professionals facing the challenge of efficiently navigating and complying with complex building laws. This innovative approach to code interpretation aims to enhance operational efficiency and compliance accuracy in the construction industry by providing precise, easily accessible information through a natural language user interface.

## Installation Instructions
Archivy is a web-based application and does not require installation. Access it via: http://archivy.io on dekstop or mobile.

## Usage
To use Archivy, simply visit the application URL, agree to the AI product safety warning, and start interacting with the chatbot by typing your construction code-related queries into the provided text box. For detailed instructions, refer to the User Guide section below.

## Features
- **Intelligent Code Interpretation**: Utilizes ChatGPT models and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for accurate responses.
- **Comprehensive Database**: Initially includes the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act Design Standards, with plans to expand.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the search for construction codes through natural language queries.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Employs a Pinecone vector database for efficient and relevant information retrieval, leveraging the latest in vector search technology.

## Architecture Overview
Archivy's architecture is built on a Python and Flask backend, incorporating ChatGPT models and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for generating human-like text responses that are contextually relevant to users' queries. The application uses a Pinecone vector database for indexing and retrieving construction code information, enabling efficient and accurate search results. This setup allows Archivy to provide rapid, contextually relevant building code interpretations, significantly reducing the time and effort required for professionals to comply with construction standards. The integration of these advanced technologies supports scalability and future expansions, ensuring that Archivy remains at the forefront of construction code interpretation solutions.
