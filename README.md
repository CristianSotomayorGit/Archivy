# Archivy: Simplifying Construction Code Interpretation

## Project Description
Archivy is a Python and Flask-based web application designed to streamline the interpretation of construction codes for industry professionals. By integrating advanced machine learning models, including ChatGPT and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, Archivy offers a user-friendly platform for quickly accessing accurate building code information. Targeted at architects, contractors, and construction professionals, Archivy addresses the industry's challenge of efficiently navigating and complying with complex building laws, enhancing operational efficiency and compliance accuracy.

## Installation Instructions
Archivy is a web-based application and does not require installation. Access it via: http://archivy.io

## Usage
To use Archivy, simply visit the application URL, agree to the AI product safety warning, and start interacting with the chatbot by typing your construction code-related queries into the provided text box. For detailed instructions, refer to the User Guide section below.

## Features
- **Intelligent Code Interpretation**: Utilizes ChatGPT models and a RAG system for accurate responses.
- **Comprehensive Database**: Initially includes the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act Design Standards, with plans to expand.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the search for construction codes through natural language queries.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests for any enhancements, bug fixes, or documentation improvements. Ensure to follow our coding standards and guidelines.

## License
Archivy is released under a standard open-source license. For more details, see the LICENSE file in the project repository.

## Contact Information
For support or to discuss the project, contact Cristian Sotomayor at csotom2@wgu.edu.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the construction professionals who participated in alpha and beta testing.
- Appreciation for the open-source tools and libraries utilized in this project.

## Technical Requirements
- No installation required for end-users. Developers interested in contributing should have Python 3.8+, Flask, and experience with ChatGPT and vector databases.

## Architecture Overview
Archivy leverages a Python and Flask backend with ChatGPT models for generating human-like text responses. The application incorporates a RAG system to enhance response accuracy by retrieving information from a Pinecone vector database, ensuring relevant and precise building code interpretations. The architecture is designed to be scalable, supporting future expansions to include more comprehensive databases of construction laws and codes.
